Thus a natural question arises in the opposite direction: Under what conditions a smooth minimal action of a group on a compact manifold is Lebesgue-ergodic? The example of Furstenberg [5] shows that, in general, minimality does not imply ergodicity. Namely, Furstenberg constructed an analytic diffeomorphism of T 2 which preserves the Lebesgue measure and is minimal but not ergodic. Folkloric Katok-Herman Theorem says that a C 1 -diffeomorphism of the circle with derivative of bounded variation is ergodic provided its rotation number is irrational (see [11, 7] ). Contrarily in [14] , minimal C 1 -diffeomorphisms of the circle are constructed which are not ergodic.

These analyses showed that measurements of resulting invariant mass distribution endpoints and shapes can be exploited to determine the masses of the intermediate SUSY particles. Shapes of various relevant invariant mass distributions have first been calculated analytically at LO in [18] and they might be important to resolve ambiguities in mass measurements from kinematic endpoints [33] . In figure 1 , for illustrative purposes, normalized invariant mass distributions in m jll , m jl(high) and m jl(low) are displayed for two benchmark points (with details given in the corresponding sections of this paper). At this point we only want to emphasize that such shapes are very sensitive to the model parameters; on the other hand, they can be distorted by higher order corrections, affecting thus the accuracy of endpoint determination techniques. Such invariant mass distributions, due to correlations between particles in the decay chain, can be used also for spin measurements of the intermediate sparticles [34] . In this way, e.g., a SUSY model can be discriminated from an Universal Extra Dimension (UED) model, see e.g., [35, 36] and [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] .

The predictions depend on the cuts applied and in general can be different from the result obtained rescaling LO predictions with flat K-factors obtained from the cross-section of just production without decays and cuts included. However, in particular cases, results obtained in this approximation and using our calculation can be in very good agreement, provided that only the contributing chirality configurations are included in the calculation of the flat K-factor.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": []}, {"section": "Conclusions", "text": "In our framework, results can be easily extended including off-shell effects in the electroweak decay chain.
